These scripts have not been tested.

It is possible that they may fail for lack of specification of the target
database in the table references.  This could be handled in one of two ways:
-   Designation of a default database in your SQL client.
-   Editing the file to prepend each reference to a table with 'books.'.

If you have trouble and those suggestions aren't helpful, please contact me.
