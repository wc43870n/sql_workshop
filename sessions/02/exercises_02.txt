These exercises require the database 'books'.  A setup script for this is in
the materials, see sessions/02/setup/.

EXPLORATION
- Write a query that confirms that the database has been created on your database server.

- Write a query that shows which tables are in the new database.

- Write queries showing the fields in the tables 'authors' and 'publishers'
    
JOINS

Write a query "joining" all the rows in authors with all the rows in publishers.

Okay, that's a lot of data.  Return all joined rows, but only the fields author
id, author first and last name, author city, publisher city, and publisher
name.
-   It might be useful to print out this output, inspect it, and circle those
    author city / publisher city pairs where the cities are the same.
-   Think a bit on how you would modify this query to filter it to get only
    those records.  What logical statement is true of only those?

Write a query showing which authors live in the same city as a publisher.
Return the author's first and last name, id, the city, and the name of the
publiser in that city.

Write a query that lists only the author ids of those authors who live in the
same city as a publisher.


Write a LEFT JOIN query, joing authors and publishers on city.
- You should get more rows than when you did the first query.
- Look at the output.  What logical statement is true for those authors who do
  not live in the same city as a publisher?

Write a query that returns only those authors that do not live in the same city
as a publiser.
