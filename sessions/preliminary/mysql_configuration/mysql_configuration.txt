MySQL Configuration and Permissions
-----------------------------------
Running MySQL queries directly from the command line requires a MySQL account with appropriate permissions, and a MySQL configuration file in a default location.

By 'running a query from the command line', I mean a command on the command line of the form:
    << mysql < somequery.sql >>

Note that this discussion applies only to MySQL, and to any other SQL implementation.

Discussion
----------
MySQL has an internal apparatus for controlling the availability of information and the modification of data.  This allows the program to enforce policy for topics like information confidentiality, security, and prevention of accidental data loss.

This apparatus works through a system of user accounts, very similar to the user accounts on an operating system.  MySQL installations begin with a 'superuser' account, with unlimited ability to access and modify data.  That user can create other users and assign them privileges.  

Using the command line MySQL client requires establishment of a user account with appropriate permissions, and configuration of the operating system user account to use that MySQL account by default.

That operating system is handled by creation of a file, named '.my.cnf', and saving it in the user's home directory.  When mysql is launched from the command line, it looks for configuration files in a number of directories, this root directory among them -- on finding a configuration file, it reads in the file's data and uses it as its defaults.


Steps
-----

Create and Permission the MySQL User:
- Create the user by editing the file create_mysql_user.sql to provide a
  user name (generally the same as your computer account) and a password
  (anything).
- Run that query, as the MySQL root account, with this command:
    mysql -u root -p < create_mysql_users.sql

    - You will be prompted for the MySQL root user password.  By default this
      is empty, so just hit 'Enter'.  Contact me if that does not work.


Create the Configuration File:
- Edit example.my.cnf to provide the user name and password created in the
  user creation query
- Save that file to your home directory as .my.cnf.
    - You can reach your home directory from the command line with command <<
      cd ~ >>.  On Macs it is the directory designated 
      by '/Users/[your account name]'.
    - This file probably will _not_ appear in Finder.  The '.' at the beginning
      tells the operating system to make this a 'hidden' file.  Finder settings
      can be modified to show these files.  They can be see on the command line
      with  << ls -a >>.

After these steps, you should be able to run queries from the command line.
